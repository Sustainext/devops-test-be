<h2 id="effectiveness">10. Assessing Effectiveness</h2>

<p>To measure its effectiveness in preventing forced and child labour, ABC takes the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting up a regular review or audit of the entity's policies and procedures related to forced labour and child labour</li>
  <li>
    Tracking relevant performance indicators, such as levels of employee awareness, numbers of cases reported and solved through grievance mechanisms, and numbers of contracts with anti-forced labour
    and child labour clauses
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  ABC also benchmarks its practices against industry standards and collaborates with external partners to continuously improve its approach. Controlled entities within the organization are required to
  follow the same monitoring framework and report their results as part of ABC’s centralized compliance review process.
</p>

<p>These ongoing efforts help ensure that ABC’s activities and supply chains remain aligned with its ethical sourcing commitments and obligations under Bill S-211.</p>
