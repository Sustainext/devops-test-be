<h2 id="risks">5. Risks of Forced Labour and Child Labour</h2>

<p>ABC assesses forced labour and child labour risks in its operations and supply chains through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Risk mapping of supply chains:</strong> ABC conducts regular assessments of suppliers, subcontractors, and partners across key regions to identify potential risks related to forced and
    child labour. This process includes field audits, third-party assessments, and employee interviews at key supplier locations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Supplier risk categorization:</strong> Based on the risk mapping, suppliers are categorized as high, medium, or low risk. This categorization helps prioritize monitoring and intervention
    strategies. In 2024, 10 suppliers were categorized as high risk, 20 as medium risk, and 50 as low risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Collaboration with industry bodies to identify risk factors:</strong> ABC collaborates with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to identify industry-specific risk factors and develop
    best practices for mitigating forced and child labour risks. ABC also participates in workshops organized by the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Identified risks may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Country-specific labour law violations:</strong> In China, Vietnam, and India, local labour laws are inconsistently enforced, with instances of forced overtime and underage workers found
    in specific factories within ABC’s supply chain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Industry-related risks in sourcing materials/services:</strong> Sourcing of tin and tantalum from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) poses risks, as these materials have been
    historically linked to child labour in mining operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Subcontracting risks in the supply chain:</strong> ABC identified significant subcontracting risks in Bangladesh, particularly in garment manufacturing. Subcontractors often fail to adhere
    to ABC’s labour standards, putting workers at risk of exploitation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In 2024, ABC conducted a thorough supplier risk assessment, identifying 15 high-risk suppliers. ABC implemented corrective action plans with these suppliers, which included worker training programs,
  facility upgrades, and closer monitoring through third-party audits. ABC has also established a Supplier Code of Conduct and introduced penalties for non-compliance.
</p>

  ABC continues to enhance supply chain visibility, ensuring compliance with sustainability, ethical sourcing, and human rights commitments through ongoing collaboration with suppliers and
  stakeholders.
