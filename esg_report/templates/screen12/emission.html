<h2>12. Environment</h2>

<p>At <strong>[Company Name]</strong>, we recognize our responsibility to minimize the environmental impact of our
    operations and to contribute positively to the health of our planet. Our environmental strategy is focused on
    reducing emissions, managing materials responsibly, conserving water, optimizing energy use, reducing waste,
    protecting biodiversity, and improving air quality.</p>

<h3>12.1. Emissions</h3>

<p>(Here, graphic can be added to present emission reductions or total GHG emissions)</p>
<p>We manage our emissions through a comprehensive strategy that includes setting reduction targets, implementing
    energy-efficient technologies, and monitoring our progress.</p>

<hr>

<h4>12.1.2. Scope 1 GHG Emissions (GRI 305-1-a, b, c, d, e, f, g)</h4>
<p>Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations, such as fuel combustion on-site. We
    measure and report these emissions annually, striving to reduce them through process optimization and cleaner
    technologies.</p>

<h4>12.1.3. Scope 2 GHG Emissions (GRI 305-2-a, b, c, d, e, f, g)</h4>
<p>Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam. We aim to
    reduce Scope 2 emissions by increasing our use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency.</p>

<h4>12.1.4. Scope 3 GHG Emissions (GRI 305-3-a, b, c, d, e, f, g)</h4>
<p>Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions in our value chain, such as those from suppliers and product
    use. We collaborate with suppliers to reduce these emissions and support initiatives that encourage sustainable
    practices throughout our supply chain.</p>
